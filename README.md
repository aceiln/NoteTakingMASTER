# Master Note Taker
## Description
The motivation of this project is to store a collection of notes in one place that allowed the user to delete, save, and add new notes. This project was built to expand and have a deeper understanding of express and the things that you are able to do with it. The problem that it solved is allowing the user to have notes and reminders kept in one place for them to easily use and access. I learned how to make a delete function and use it within my notes.
